# Badi Up App
Badi Up is a moble app being designed by Gospel Aid Japan to combat sex trafficking among the Badi community of Nepal. Badi girls are subject to systemic prostitution because of the caste system still prevalent in rural Nepal. 
The app provides supporters a way to buy products manufactured by the Badi girls, products whose profits contribute to the betterment of the Badi girls and get connected on various current events related to the Badi girls and the human trafficking problem in general. 
We hope to give the girls a future and bring them up from darkness into light. We believe that the Love of Jesus Christ is capable in accomplishing this impossible task.
